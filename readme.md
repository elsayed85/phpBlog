The candidate is expected to create a PHP-based blog system with OOP.

User registration (create a new user account).
User login (authenticate users).
User logout.
Create a new blog post (only authenticated users can create posts).
Read/view a list of blog posts.
Read/view a single blog post.

The candidate should use appropriate OOP principles such as classes, objects, and encapsulation.
The code should be well-structured, clean, and maintainable.
Implement error handling to ensure that operations like updating or deleting a non-existent blog post do not cause issues.

Implement user authentication and session management to secure the blog system.
Exam Requirements:

Create a set of classes to implement the above functionality. Consider separate classes for users and blog posts.
Use a database for data storage (e.g., MySQL) and provide the necessary SQL schema to create the users and blog posts tables.
Include user authentication and session management to secure the blog system.
Include a sample usage of your classes to demonstrate how the blog system with authentication works.
